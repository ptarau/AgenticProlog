# AgenticProlog
### Agentic Framework using a Java-based Prolog

### see README.txt files in prologL and components

### what we have so far:

with the Java code compiled, the Prolog code
     is bootstrapped using the bytecode file in prologL/wam.bp

executable scripts lpl and agpl are created and copied in the
users ~/bin directory

lpl activates the plain LinProlog system from prologL

agpl activates the the extended Prolog system containing
the additions in components/src

More to come, the focus is on components/agents, see also
papers in folder docs for where we are heading.

Next, Prolog adaptors and the Prolog agents will be added to the framework.

Enjoy,
Paul Tarau
